</table><br><details><summary>here some details about horror story</summary>The storm rolled in just as Leah reached the front gate of the ancient Blackthorne Manor.

    She was a paranormal investigator, drawn to the house by rumors of vanishings and whispers in the dark.
    
    Villagers avoided the place, calling it cursed, abandoned since the Blackthorne family mysteriously disappeared decades ago.
    
    Thunder cracked the sky as she stepped inside, flashlight cutting through layers of dust and cobwebs.
    
    The air was thick, not with age, but with something else—something watching.
    
    Her recorder immediately picked up static, though the batteries were fresh.
    
    Leah spoke into the silence, “Is anyone here?” and the silence almost seemed to respond.
    
    A floorboard creaked in the hall above her, but she was alone.
    
    She followed the sound, heart thudding, every breath echoing in the stillness.
    
    At the top of the stairs, the hallway stretched impossibly long, more than the house's layout should allow.
    
    Doors lined the walls like teeth in a grin, each one cracked slightly open.
    
    She picked one at random and stepped inside what seemed like a child’s bedroom.
    
    Toys were scattered across the floor, and the rocking horse rocked slowly, though the air was still.
    
    Her recorder crackled again—this time a faint voice: "Don't play with them..."
    
    Leah spun around, but there was no one there.
    
    She backed out and moved to the next door, which revealed a cold, lifeless bathroom.
    
    The mirror was fogged as if someone had just stepped out of a hot shower.
    
    On it, a message appeared, written by an invisible hand: “Help me.”
    
    She gasped, stepping back, bumping into something soft behind her—
    
    But it was just a curtain... or so she thought.
    
    Fingers brushed her neck.
    
    She ran out, slamming the door, breath ragged and eyes wild.
    
    The hallway now looked different—twisted, longer, the wallpaper bleeding shadows.
    
    Doors slammed shut one by one behind her as if the house was sealing her in.
    
    She reached the end of the hallway, where a massive wooden door stood—one that wasn’t there before.
    
    Against instinct, she opened it.
    
    A spiral staircase descended into darkness, colder than anything she’d felt before.
    
    Her flashlight flickered as she descended, each step creaking like a scream.
    
    At the bottom was a stone room filled with old portraits—faces scratched out violently.
    
    In the center, a circle of dolls surrounded a blackened, scorched spot on the floor.
    
    The temperature dropped suddenly; her breath came out in white clouds.
    
    From behind her, she heard a voice like glass cracking: “You found us.”
    
    She turned to see a mirror—freestanding, untouched by dust.
    
    Her reflection didn’t mimic her—it smiled when she didn’t.
    
    She reached out, and the reflection grabbed her hand.
    
    Her scream echoed, but no sound came from her mouth.
    
    She tried to pull away, but it was too late—the mirror pulled her in.
    
    Everything went black.
    
    The recorder hit the floor, still crackling, now repeating a single phrase: “We live in the glass…”
    
    Upstairs, the rocking horse began to move again, though the house was still empty—or so it seemed.
