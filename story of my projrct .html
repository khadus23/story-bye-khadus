    <h3>It was past midnight when Ravi’s car broke down on a desolate forest road.

        With no signal on his phone and rain pouring, he spotted an old cabin nearby.
        
        Hoping to find shelter, he knocked, but the door creaked open by itself.
        
        The cabin was dusty, abandoned-looking, yet strangely warm inside.
        
        A fireplace burned quietly, though no one was around to tend it.
        
        On the mantle, he saw a dusty photo of a family—faces scratched out.
        
        The air felt heavy, like it was watching him breathe.
        
        He turned to leave, but the door was no longer there—just a solid wall.
        
        Panic rose as whispers filled the room, unintelligible yet angry.
        
        The lights flickered, and shadows danced unnaturally on the walls.
        
        A loud thump came from the attic above.
        
        He climbed the stairs, drawn by a force he couldn’t resist.
        
        The attic was empty except for an old rocking chair, moving by itself.
        
        On the floor was a single note: “You shouldn't have come.”
        
        As he backed away, the attic door slammed shut behind him.
        
        The rocking chair stopped.
        
        From the shadows, a figure emerged—no eyes, no mouth, just a stitched smile.
        
        It reached for him, whispering, “One more for the house…”
        
        His screams were never heard again.
        
        Weeks later, travelers saw a new photo in the cabin—Ravi, smiling, with his eyes scratched out.
