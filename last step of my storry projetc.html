    <h1 style="background-color: brown;">congratulation finaly you joker type personality human got my story</h1>
    <h1 align="center" style="background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0);color: beige;">here is my first story on rutuja</h1>
    <p style="background-color: darkgrey;">Rutuja always loved exploring abandoned places.

        Her town had one legend everyone feared — the Silent House.
        
        It stood at the edge of the forest, cloaked in vines and time.
        
        No one dared to go near it after sunset.
        
        They said the house remembers everyone who enters.
        
        But Rutuja wasn’t afraid of stories.
        
        On a dare from her friends, she decided to explore it.
        
        It was a cloudy evening, just before nightfall.
        
        With a flashlight and her camera, she climbed the creaky gate.
        
        The air changed the moment she stepped inside.
        
        It was quiet — too quiet.
        
        Not even the sound of crickets or wind.
        
        The house smelled of damp wood and dust.
        
        Paint peeled off the walls like shedding skin.
        
        Rutuja took photos, whispering to herself to stay calm.
        
        “Just some old wood and shadows,” she said aloud.
        
        Her flashlight flickered as she entered the hallway.
        
        Mirrors lined the walls, each cracked at the corner.
        
        As she passed one, her reflection didn’t move.
        
        She froze.
        
        Her reflection smiled.
        
        But Rutuja hadn’t.
        
        The flashlight slipped from her hand.
        
        She backed away, heart pounding.
        
        “It’s just my mind,” she whispered.
        
        A whisper echoed, “Just your mind…”
        
        She turned — no one there.
        
        The door behind her slammed shut.
        
        The air grew heavier, colder.
        
        The house was awake.
        
        Rutuja ran into the living room.
        
        Furniture was covered in sheets, untouched for years.
        
        Yet one rocking chair moved slightly.
        
        She approached it, breath shallow.
        
        A doll sat in the chair.
        
        Its eyes followed her.
        
        She turned away—and it giggled.
        
        She spun around, but the doll was gone.
        
        A thump came from upstairs.
        
        Against all instinct, she followed the sound.
        
        The stairs groaned under her feet.
        
        The second floor was darker, colder.
        
        A hallway stretched longer than it looked from outside.
        
        The doors were all closed except one.
        
        It creaked open, revealing a child's bedroom.
        
        Toys were scattered like someone left in a hurry.
        
        The window was broken, shards on the floor.
        
        On the wall, something was scratched in: “I’m not alone.”
        
        Her camera clicked by itself.
        
        She looked down — it was off.
        
        “Rutuja…”
        
        The voice was soft, unfamiliar, childlike.
        
        She turned around — nothing.
        
        “Rutuja, come play…”
        
        She ran down the hall, panting.
        
        Doors slammed one by one behind her.
        
        The floor beneath her felt wet.
        
        She looked down — red handprints.
        
        Panic took over.
        
        She reached for her phone — no signal, 1% battery.
        
        It died.
        
        She screamed, but the house swallowed the sound.
        
        She ran into the nearest room and slammed the door.
        
        It was a nursery.
        
        Music played from a wind-up box.
        
        But she hadn't touched it.
        
        The lullaby grew slower… and darker.
        
        A shadow appeared in the crib.
        
        A baby?
        
        No… something crawling.
        
        The figure rose — tall, twisted, with hollow eyes.
        
        Rutuja stumbled backward into a closet.
        
        She shut the door, holding her breath.
        
        Silence returned.
        
        Then a voice, inches from her ear:
        
        “You can’t leave now.”
        
        She burst out, running blindly down the stairs.
        
        The walls seemed to close in.
        
        The mirrors now reflected her running in circles.
        
        Her reflection stood still, watching.
        
        She saw the front door — wide open.
        
        She ran for it.
        
        But as she crossed the threshold…
        
        She was back in the hallway again.
        
        Same cracked mirrors.
        
        Same rocking chair.
        
        Same doll.
        
        “You stayed too long,” a voice said.
        
        She screamed again.
        
        And again.
        
        But no one outside ever heard her.
        
        Days passed.
        
        Her friends returned to the house looking for her.
        
        They found her camera on the floor.
        
        The last photo: Rutuja, standing behind them, eyes black.
        
        They left, terrified.
        
        But every night, Rutuja walks the Silent House.
        
        Trapped in its endless halls.
        
        Waiting for the next name to whisper.
        
        Maybe yours. </p>
<center><h3 >thanx for read this story on rutuja </h3></center>
<center><h1 style="background-color: black;color: beige;">now this was the second story in this story having 2 boys and 2 girls and the name is raj,aryan,rutuja,prerna</h1></center>
<br>
<p style="background-color: darkgrey;">Prerna had always loved road trips.

    So when Raj called and invited her for a weekend getaway, she agreed without hesitation.
    
    They were meeting in a remote hill town called Devkund.
    
    Rutuja, Aryan, and Raj had already reached by the time Prerna arrived.
    
    The reunion was warm, filled with laughter and stories from college.
    
    Raj suggested they explore an abandoned village nearby that he found on an old map.
    
    "It’ll be fun. Like our own little ghost adventure," he grinned.
    
    Prerna hesitated, but the others were excited.
    
    The path to the village was overgrown and silent.
    
    Even the birds didn’t seem to sing there.
    
    After an hour’s hike, they found it — a cluster of broken huts, hidden deep in the woods.
    
    “This place is… dead,” Rutuja whispered.
    
    Aryan chuckled nervously, “Perfect for ghost stories tonight.”
    
    They decided to set up tents near a half-collapsed temple.
    
    The sun dipped early behind the mountains.
    
    As darkness fell, a strange unease settled among them.
    
    Prerna kept feeling eyes on her, though no one was there.
    
    That night, as they sat around a small fire, Raj brought out a storybook.
    
    It was old, its pages yellowed and brittle.
    
    “Found it in the temple ruins,” he said.
    
    He read aloud a story titled "The Four Who Came and Never Left."
    
    Prerna's smile faded.
    
    The story mentioned names — eerily similar to theirs.
    
    Four travelers. A cursed village. A broken temple.
    
    “This is too weird,” Prerna said, standing up.
    
    But the others insisted it was just a coincidence.
    
    Later that night, Prerna heard whispers outside her tent.
    
    She peeked out — and saw a woman in white, standing near the tree line.
    
    The woman turned — her eyes hollow, her mouth sewn shut.
    
    Prerna screamed, waking the others.
    
    But when they looked, the woman was gone.
    
    “Maybe you were dreaming,” Aryan said, but he looked pale.
    
    The next morning, Raj was missing.
    
    His tent was empty, his phone left behind.
    
    They searched the village ruins for hours — nothing.
    
    Then Rutuja found the same storybook, but now the title read: "The Three Who Stayed."
    
    “This wasn’t here before,” she whispered.
    
    Prerna’s heart pounded.
    
    Aryan tried to call for help — no signal.
    
    They decided to leave immediately.
    
    But the path they came from… was gone.
    
    The forest had changed, like it moved around them.
    
    “This doesn’t make sense!” Aryan shouted.
    
    They wandered for hours, only to return to the same spot.
    
    Rutuja was next to vanish.
    
    One moment she was beside Prerna, the next — gone.
    
    No footsteps, no sound. Just gone.
    
    The storybook now read: "The Two Who Wandered.”
    
    Aryan refused to touch it.
    
    They decided to stay awake through the night.
    
    Sometime past midnight, Aryan heard someone calling his name.
    
    It was Raj’s voice.
    
    He ran toward it before Prerna could stop him.
    
    “Raj, is that you?!”
    
    Then silence.
    
    Prerna waited. He never came back.
    
    The fire died out on its own.
    
    The woods grew colder.
    
    Something moved in the shadows.
    
    Prerna was alone.
    
    Her phone battery was dead.
    
    Her compass spun wildly.
    
    The temple behind her seemed closer now.
    
    She turned — the entrance was open.
    
    Inside, candles were lit in a circle.
    
    In the center lay the storybook.
    
    It now read: "The One Who Knows."
    
    Prerna stepped back, trembling.
    
    From the shadows, the woman in white returned.
    
    This time, she pointed at Prerna.
    
    A whisper entered her head: “Write the next story.”
    
    Prerna tried to run, but the woods were gone.
    
    Everything was pages. Endless, blank, yellow pages.
    
    She was inside the story.
    
    Her thoughts weren’t her own anymore.
    
    She saw a pen float in midair.
    
    Her hands moved without her will.
    
    She began to write.
    
    “They will come again…”
    
    “New names… new faces…”
    
    Her body began to fade.
    
    The pen dropped to the ground.
    
    Outside, the temple door shut by itself.
    
    The wind carried laughter — not hers.
    
    Years passed.
    
    New hikers came.
    
    Among them, a girl picked up an old book.
    
    The title read: “The Four Who Entered…”
    
    She laughed. “Sounds creepy. Should we read it out loud?”
    
    Her friend, named Rutuja, said, “Why not?”
    
    Far away, in a space that was neither here nor there, Prerna opened her eyes.
    
    She couldn’t speak.
    
    She couldn’t scream.
    
    She was watching through the story.
    
    Through the words.
    
    Through the ink.
    
    Forever trapped.
    
    Forever writing.
    
    The cursed book waits in the ruins.
    
    And Prerna waits with it.</p>
